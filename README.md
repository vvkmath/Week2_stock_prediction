# Week2_stock_prediction
The Jupyter notebook file demonstrates three regression-based appproaches to predict the adjusted closing price for a stock. The three methods are listed as below. 
1. Quadratic Regression
2. Gradient Boosting
3. Gradient Boosting with 30-day stock prices as features

The 100-day moving average of the adjusted closing price is used as the feature for the first two models, whereas the indvidual stock prices for the previous month (30 days) are used as features for the third model.
